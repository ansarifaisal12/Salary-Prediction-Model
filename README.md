# Salary-Prediction-Model
# Overview:
This is a simple salary prediction model built using Linear Regression. The goal of this model is to predict the salary of an employee based on their years of experience in a particular field. The model takes in the input feature, which is the years of experience, and outputs the predicted salary.

# Requirements:
To use this model, you will need Python 3.x installed on your computer, along with the following libraries:

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
# Dataset:
The dataset used to train this model is a simple CSV file containing two columns: 'YearsExperience' and 'Salary'. The 'YearsExperience' column contains the number of years of experience an employee has in a particular field, and the 'Salary' column contains the corresponding salary for that employee. The dataset used for this model can be found in the 'data' folder.
# Usage:
To use this model, you can simply run the 'salary_prediction.py' file. The script will automatically load the dataset, split it into training and testing sets, train the model, and output the predicted salary for a given number of years of experience.

To modify the model, you can adjust the hyperparameters such as the learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size in the 'salary_prediction.py' file. You can also try experimenting with different features or adding more layers to the model to improve its performance.

# Results:
Once the model is trained, it will output the predicted salary for a given number of years of experience. The model's performance can also be evaluated using various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared.

# Conclusion:
This salary prediction model can be used to estimate the salary of an employee based on their years of experience in a particular field. However, it's important to keep in mind that this is a simple model and may not accurately predict salaries for employees with unusual or unique circumstances.
